					title= "Computer Crashed Again"
					alt= "Cry it out girl"/> 
			<p>Well now... 5 days into the school year and my computer dies (or is at least in a coma like state on the verge of death)</p>
		<h2>Now what?</h2>
			<p>I tried out some things I found here: <a href="http://www.dummies.com">For Dummies!</a>
			Also tried
			<ul> 
				<li> Crying in the corner
				<li> Praying to whatever God will listen (Dear Baby Jesus-Allah-Beelzebub, come help)
				<li> Cursing... lots of cursing
				<li> <small><em>*Note: Crying, praying, or cursing will <strong>not</strong> fix your computer. It will only result in the loss of time necessary that you should be dedicated to fixing your computer.</em></small></p>
		<h3>No Hope?</h3> 
			<p>But alas, nothing worked! I am but a mere mortal that has to give in to a somewhat higher power. So now I am going here: <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar/"> Apple "Genius" bar </a>
				(I have a love/hate relationship with the Geniuses at the bar.... mostly hate at this point)</p>
					<h4>$MONEY-MONEY-MONEY$</h4>
						<p>Dear Baby Jesus-Allah-Beelzebub do you have any loose change?</p>
