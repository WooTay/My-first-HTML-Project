					<p class="special">Well now... 5 days into the school year and my computer dies (or is at least in a coma like state on the verge of death)</p>
			<article>		
			<h2>NOW WHAT!?</h2>
			<section>
				<p class="specialS">I tried out some things I found here: <a href="http://www.dummies.com">For Dummies!</a><br/>It stated that I could try what is called a "Safe Reboot". This is done by turning your computer on + holding the shift key down.</p></section><hr/> 
				<section class="specialS">Also tried
						<ul> 
							<li> Crying in the corner
							<li> Praying to whatever God will listen (Dear Baby Jesus-Allah-Beelzebub, come help)
							<li> Cursing... lots of cursing<br/><small><em>*Note: Crying, praying, or cursing will <strong>not</strong> fix your computer. It will only result in the loss of time necessary that you should be dedicated to fixing your computer.</em></small></ul></section></article> 
							
			<h2>No Hope?</h2> 
				<p id="article">But alas, nothing worked! I am but a mere mortal that has to give in to a somewhat higher power. So now I am going here: <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar/"> Apple "Genius" bar </a>(I have a love/hate relationship with the Geniuses at the bar.... mostly hate at this point)</p>
				
			<h3>$MONEY-MONEY-MONEY$</h3>
				<p class="FunnyMoney">Dear Baby Jesus-Allah-Beelzebub do you have any loose change?</p><hr/>
