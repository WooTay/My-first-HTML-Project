					title= Computer Crashed Again
					alt= Cry it out girl/>
			<p> Goddam, my computer crashed yesterday!</p>
		<h2> Now what? </h2>
			<p> Well now... 5 days into the school year and my computer dies (or is at least in a coma like state on the verge of death)
			I tried out some things I found here: <a href="http://www.dummies.com"> For Dummies! </a> </p>
		<h3> No Hope? </h3> 
			<p> Nothing worked! So now I am going here: <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar/"> Apple "Genius" bar </a>
				(I have a love/hate relationship with the Geniuses at the bar.... mostly hate at this point)
